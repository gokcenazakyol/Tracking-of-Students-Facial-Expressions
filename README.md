## Problem Definition

One of the biggest reasons for the inefficiency of
modern education is the low attention span of the
students. Studies show that the students tend to
get distracted way more in online classes.(Balan
et al., 2021) In this study, the main goal is to track
the facial expression of the students in an online
class and convey feedback of studentsâ€™ feelings
or attention to the instructor. With the use of the
emotion recognition system in online education,
the instructor will be able to directly observe the
points where the students lose their attention and
make the education more efficient. In this context, YOLO, an object detection method, was used
within the scope of the project. The YOLO model
was specially trained with a data set consisting
of separate classes (such as sad, happy, sleepy).
Within the scope of the results obtained, the applied model can detect the mood of the student.
